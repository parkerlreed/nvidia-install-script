nvidia-install-script
=====================

Pulled the commands from http://wiki.debian.org/NvidiaGraphicsDrivers and packaged them into a script. Should work for any newer Nvidia card.

Caution: At the momemt it creates an xorg.conf file or overwrites the current one you have. Be sure to backup.

Installation: Run sudo ./nvidia.sh
